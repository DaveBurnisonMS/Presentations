# Dave Burnison's Presentations
This repo contains PDFs of presentations that I have used recently. These PDFs have many links including demos on YouTube and resources that you can use to dive in to specific GitHub capabilities. Share these PDFs with your colleagues so they can watch the demos and dig into the resources to get up to speed quickly.
